      <h2>Hi!</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a rising sophomore at Cornell, double majoring in electrical & computer engineering, and
        computer science. I love cooking & baking, karate, VFX, cinematography, and of course,
        coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was born in Nigeria, and I've lived all over the U.S., although when people ask I tell
        them
        I'm from Seattle because I lived in Bellevue & Kirkland for about 9 years of my 19-year
        life.

      <h2>Cooking</h2>
      <p>
        I know, we're in quarantine, everyone is cooking and baking. But look at this:

      <div class='cooking-dish'>
        <img
          src="/img/orange-chicken.jpg"
          alt="Spicy orange chicken with butter rice"
        >
        <h3>Spicy orange chicken with butter rice</h3>
