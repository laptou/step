        <p>
        I'm a rising sophomore at Cornell, double majoring in electrical & computer engineering, and
        computer science. I love cooking & baking, karate, VFX, cinematography, and of course,
        coding.

        them
        I'm from Seattle because I lived in Bellevue & Kirkland for about 9 years of my 19-year
        life.
