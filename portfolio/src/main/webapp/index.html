    <h2>Hi!</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a rising sophomore at Cornell, double majoring in electrical & computer engineering, and
      computer science. I love cooking & baking, karate, VFX, cinematography, and of course, coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born in Nigeria, and I've lived all over the U.S., although when people ask I tell them
      I'm from Seattle because I lived in Bellevue & Kirkland for about 9 years of my 19-year life.

    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>
      I know, we're in quarantine, everyone is cooking and baking. But look at this:

      <h3>Spicy orange chicken with butter rice</h3>
      <section class='blurb'>
        <p>
          This is based on
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_87Ow7HTdQ">Joshua Weissman's recipe</a>. I
          don't
          have Serrano chiles, because my mom doesn't believe in them, but I was able to compensate
          by
          adding just a little bit of habañero oil. I also didn't have enough cornstarch to make as
          much as I was hoping to, but I was able to get away with this by substituting the
          remainder
          with tapioca flour.

        <p>
          I can't even remember which recipe I used for this one. I should really keep better
          records. But that's not the point. The point is that this cornbread was soft, delicate,
          and delicious, with a lightweight maple syrup flavour. If I were to make it again, I'd go
          harder on the maple syrup, and also try adding jalapeños.

      <section class='blurb'>
        <p>
          I made this one by synthesizing these two recipes for cheesecake 
          (<a href="https://bakerbynature.com/the-best-new-york-style-cheesecake/">one</a>,
          <a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/340227/raspberry-swirl-cheesecake">two</a>),
          relying mostly on the second one. However, I did not make the raspberry sauce on the spot,
          like in the recipe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, I made raspberry preserves two days prior by blending raspberries in a food
          processor, boiling them, adding lemon juice and just enough sugar to make it edible, and
          then refrigerating. When it was time to make the cake, I drizzled in the raspberry
          preserves after pouring the batter into the pan, and then dragged a knife through it in a
          grid pattern to create the swirls.
        </p>
        <p>
          I added ice cream cones to the graham crackers in the crust. It makes it a little sweeter,
          and also gives it that extra <code>cronch</code>. I also reduced the sugar in the cake
          from 1.5 cups to 1, and I think it could still be reduced significantly.
        </p>

      <section class='blurb'>
        <p>
          This isn't a real recipe, this is just what happened when I put the extra material from
          making raspberry preserves into some ice cream. It looks photogenic and tastes good, but
          because it's literally 60% seeds, it's crunchy in a really annoying way.
