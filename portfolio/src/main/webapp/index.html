    <h2>Hi, I'm Ibiyemi Abiodun!</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a rising sophomore at Cornell, double majoring in electrical & computer engineering, and
      computer science. I love cooking & baking, karate, VFX, cinematography, and of course, coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born in Nigeria, and I've lived all over the U.S., although when people ask I tell them
      I'm from Seattle because I lived in Bellevue & Kirkland for about 9 years of my 19-year life.
