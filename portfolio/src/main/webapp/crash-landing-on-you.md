Crash Landing on You is one of my favourite TV shows I can remember watching recently. It's about a
rich South Korean woman, successful in the face of a ruthless, unloving family, who has her plans
derailed when she gets thrown into North Korea while paragliding by a tornado. There, she meets a
North Korean army officer who not only spares her, but devotes himself to helping her get home. The
suspense in this show is amazing, the romance burns slow and doesn't feel contrived, and the
villains are excellent. Even when I could predict what's going to happen ("she can't die! she's the
main character"), I still gasped at the cliffhanger at the end of every episode. Watching an episode
or two of this show every night was the highlight of my days as I muscled through the last few weeks
of the school year.

This is also the only detailed portrayal of North Korea that I have ever seen. Of course, I have my
doubts about its accuracy, since this is a _drama_, but it was interesting to see nonetheless.
