I made this one by synthesizing these two recipes for cheesecake
([one](https://bakerbynature.com/the-best-new-york-style-cheesecake/),
[two](https://www.marthastewart.com/340227/raspberry-swirl-cheesecake)), relying mostly on the
second one. However, I did not make the raspberry sauce on the spot, like in the recipe.

Instead, I made raspberry preserves two days prior by blending raspberries in a food processor,
boiling them, adding lemon juice and just enough sugar to make it edible, and then refrigerating.
When it was time to make the cake, I drizzled in the raspberry preserves after pouring the batter
into the pan, and then dragged a knife through it in a grid pattern to create the swirls.

I added ice cream cones to the graham crackers in the crust. It makes it a
little sweeter, and also gives it that extra `cronch`. I also reduced
the sugar in the cake from 1.5 cups to 1, and I think it could still be reduced
significantly.
