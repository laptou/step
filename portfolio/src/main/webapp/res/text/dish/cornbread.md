I can't even remember which recipe I used for this one. I should really keep
better records. But that's not the point. The point is that this cornbread was
soft, delicate, and delicious, with a lightweight maple syrup flavour. If I were
to make it again, I'd go harder on the maple syrup, and also try adding
jalape√±os.
