The Boys is the TV show that finally got me to try Amazon Prime Video, and I am glad I made that
decision. For context, this is a show about what would _really_ happen if you introduced superheroes
into our hyper-capitalist American society. Starlight, a girl from middle America with a dazzling
and strong superpower, gets recruited to join the tops ranks of the hero agency, but there she
discovers corruption, abuse, and callousness: her five colleagues don't seem to have an ounce of
heroic spirit in them. One of them accidentally kills someone's girlfriend while on his way to a
club, and all that happens is a lackadaisical apology and a small legal settlement.

First, let me say that the pacing of this show is great. I binged it in 2 or 3 days, even though
it's composed of 8 1-hour episodes. I just couldn't put it down. You can feel the tension buildings
as the people that these "heroes" have wronged start to band together, and I'm so excited for season
2.

Second, I love that this show's conflicts feels as realistic as
the conflict in any superhero show can be. Your greatest opponents are hardly ever people who are
self-proclaimed evil. Instead, they are more often people who are, just like you, following their
instinct of self-preservation and trying to see what they can get away with. Unlike you, however,
they don't necessarily have the same history, priorities, or morals as you, so what looks like
self-preservation to them is an existential threat to you. This is why Starlight's struggle feels so
personal to me, even as she experiences things that I (hopefully) will never experience.
