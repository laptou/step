Jane the Virgin is one of my most classic, automatic recommendations. It's about a Latina woman
named Jane and her family as they deal with the fantastic sequence of events set off by her being
accidentally artificially inseminated with the seed of Rafael, a premier Miami hotelier. That
insemination happened because his wife, Petra, who is after his money, tried to inseminate _herself_
with his frozen sperm without his knowledge, but the plan backfired because the presiding doctor,
Luisa (who is Rafael's sister), was drunk on the job because of a breakup and switched Jane and
Petra's information. 

Do you feel like that was a spoiler? This is all revealed in the first episode. This is a show that
I love for many reasons, but chief among them is the fact that the drama feels so dazzling. The plot
is so detailed and coherent, it made me truly invested and put me on the edge of my seat when my
favourite characters were in danger. I'm generally pretty quiet when I watch TV, but JtV made me
yell and laugh out loud.
