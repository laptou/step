When you let someone else use your computer, I bet there are beads of sweat
running down your forehead. All of your senses are heightenedâ€”you've got to make
sure that they don't type something they shouldn't, or break anything. Maybe
it's your little cousin, or maybe it's just your tech-illiterate friend. IvyLock
solves that problem by allowing you to put a password on individual
applications, instead of having to either lock your whole computer or unlock it.

I wrote this as my submission to the Software Development competition in TSA
(Technology Student Association), and it carried me to 6th in the nation. Not
bad.
