name: Tuna salad

This one's an original, and I'm pretty proud of it for my first attempt at
making tuna salad. We didn't have any chicken, beef, or pork in the house, so I
turned to fish.

Here's the recipe:
 - 1 7oz can of tuna in water
 - 1 1/2 tbsp olive oil
 - 1/2 tbsp soy sauce
 - 1/8 red onion, diced
 - 1/8 bell pepper, diced
 - 1 tsp salt
 - 1 tsp fresh ground pepper
 - 1 tsp red pepper flakes

Throw all of this in a frying pan and stir it around until the tuna browns and
most of the water has evaporated. Then get 4 tablespoons of mayonnaise, stir it
in, and refridgerate. I ate it cold on butter toast.
