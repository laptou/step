This
[recipe](https://www.thechunkychef.com/family-favorite-baked-mac-and-cheese/)
was tricky, mostly because I thought it was a good idea to grate the cheese
while also cooking the milk. 

I made a half-portion, and didn't use a breadcrumb crust (no parmesan in the
fridge), so I only baked this for about ten minutes. I think I overcooked the
pasta a little; I would have liked it to turn out chewier. I added the paprika
that is supposed to go in the crust directly to the cheese sauce, and I used
mozzarella instead of Gruyere due to not having any Gruyere. I ate it with
chopped salami and green bell peppers, but I didn't bake those into the mac
because my little sister has a coarse palate.

Finally, I hate recipes that say "salt and pepper to taste"! Couldn't you at
least ballpark it? If I wasn't so good at cooking, this mac would have ended up
criminally under-salted. I think I ended up adding around 3/4 tsp of salt and
1tsp of fresh ground pepper.

*Note:* add a splash of new milk when attempting to reheat this stuff.
