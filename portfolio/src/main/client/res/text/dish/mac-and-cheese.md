This
[recipe](https://www.thechunkychef.com/family-favorite-baked-mac-and-cheese/)
was tricky, mostly because I thought it was a good idea to grate the cheese
while also cooking the milk. It turned out great, but I didn't do the
breadcrumbs because I didn't have any parmesan. I ate it with chopped salami and
green bell peppers, but I didn't bake them into the mac because my little sister
has a coarse palate.
